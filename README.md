### üîí **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE**

This application handles sensitive trading API credentials. Please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Keep your API credentials private**
3. **Use API keys with minimal required permissions**
4. **Regularly rotate your API keys**

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd okx-tui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Set up your API credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` file with your actual OKX API credentials:
```bash
# Get these from your OKX account -> API Management
OKX_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
OKX_API_SECRET=your-actual-api-secret  
OKX_API_PASSPHRASE=your-actual-passphrase
```
